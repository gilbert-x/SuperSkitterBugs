# SuperSkitterBugs

This is a game I am making using ChatGPT to create the functions and classes. I design, prompt, tinker, edit, and assemble the functions, classes, and loops to create the game. The skitter bugs and the backgrounds are procedurally generated. The popping sound is dynamically tuned according to the size of the skitter bug. I started making this game to learn more about Python coding, Pygame, coding with ChatGPT, and game design. It's very simple, click on the skitter bugs to 'pop' them and earn points. Keeping going until you can't keep up/give up. I recommend using either a trackball or a touch screen for the most interesting game play.

You'll need the .py file and the .wav file to play. You will also need to have some modules like Pygames installed on your computer.
